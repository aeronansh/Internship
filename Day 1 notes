What is enum in java ?

Enumerations (in general) are generally a set of related constants. 

They have been in other programming languages like C++ from beginning. BUT more powerful in Java.

Supported in Java since  JDK 1.5 release.

Enumeration in java is supported by keyword enum. enums are a special type of class that always extends java.lang.Enum.

It's a combination of class & interface features.

Why ?

1. Helps to define constants.
2. Adds type safety to constants.
3.  You can't  iterate over all constant values from i/f but with enums you can.

A simple usage will look like this:

public/default enum Direction {
   EAST,
   WEST,
   NORTH,
   SOUTH        //optionally can end with ";"
 }
Here EAST, WEST, NORTH and SOUTH are implicitely of type
public final static Direction EAST=new Direction("EAST",0) ---super("EAST",0); 
public final static Direction WEST=new Direction("WEST",1) ---super("WEST",1); 

Super class of all enums

public abstract class Enum<E extends Enum<E>>
extends Object
implements Comparable<E>, Serializable

ie. they are comparable and serializable implicitly. 
All enum types in java are singleton by default. 
So, you can compare enum types using ‘==’ operator also.
